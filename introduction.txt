# Flask:
-> Python web development framework
-> A minimal Flask application looks something like this:

    from flask import Flask
    app = Flask(__name__)

    @app.route('/')
    def hello_world():
        return 'Hello, World!'

-> To run the application, use the flask command or python -m flask. Before you can do that you need to tell your
    terminal the application to work with by exporting the FLASK_APP environment variable:
    > set FLASK_APP=hello
    > flask run
     * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/

* if the file is named app.py or wsgi.py, you donâ€™t have to set the FLASK_APP environment variable.

-> Add following code to run the flask app without using terminal:
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        app.run()

# Command line:
-> also known as "Shell"
-> interacts with the kernel
-> why use:
    - greater control
-> Common commands:
    >pwd - print working directory
    >ls - list all the files and folders in the current directory
    >cd - change directory
    >mkdir folder_name - make new folder/directory eg: mkdir test
    >touch file_name - create a new file eg: touch main.py
    >rm file_name - remove the file
    >cd .. - navigate one step up to the parent folder
    >rm -rf folder_name - forcibly remove the folder
